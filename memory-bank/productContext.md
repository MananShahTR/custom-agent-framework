# Product Context: Custom AI Agents Framework

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Building AI agents with Claude requires significant boilerplate code, repetitive integration patterns, and complex tool management. Developers face challenges with:

1. **Fragmented Tool Integration**: Each tool (web search, file access, APIs) requires custom implementation
2. **MCP Complexity**: Model Context Protocol integration is complex and poorly documented
3. **Agent Specialization**: No clear patterns for building domain-specific agents (research, content, etc.)
4. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Difficult to build systems where agents hand off tasks to each other
5. **Production Readiness**: Lack of error handling, logging, and resource management

### Market Gap
While there are AI agent frameworks, most are either:
- Too complex for simple use cases (LangChain, CrewAI)
- Too basic for production use (simple chat wrappers)
- Focused on specific LLMs (OpenAI-centric frameworks)
- Lacking proper Claude integration patterns

## What This Framework Provides

### Core Value Propositions

#### 1. **Simplicity First**
```python
# Create an agent in 3 lines
agent = Agent(
    name="Research Assistant",
    description="Helps with research tasks",
    enable_web_search=True
)
response = await agent.run_async("What are the latest AI developments?")
```

#### 2. **Production Ready**
- Comprehensive error handling
- Resource cleanup (MCP connections)
- Logging and debugging support
- API key validation
- Memory management

#### 3. **Extensible Architecture**
- Clean base classes for custom agents
- Pluggable tool system
- MCP server integration
- Custom system prompts

#### 4. **Specialized Agents**
- **Basic Agent**: General conversation and tool use
- **Web Search Agent**: Optimized for web research
- **Deep Research Agent**: Comprehensive research with citations
- **Multi-Agent System**: Coordinated agent workflows

## User Experience Goals

### For Developers
- **5-minute setup**: From clone to running agent
- **Clear examples**: Copy-paste examples for common use cases
- **Extensible patterns**: Easy to add custom tools and agents
- **Production ready**: Built-in error handling and resource management

### For End Users
- **Natural interaction**: Conversational interface with tool access
- **Reliable results**: Proper error handling and fallbacks
- **Rich responses**: Citations, sources, and structured output
- **Fast responses**: Optimized tool execution and caching

## Success Metrics

## How It Should Work

### Basic Flow
1. **Agent Creation**: Simple constructor with configuration
2. **Tool Auto-loading**: Web search, Google Drive based on flags
3. **MCP Integration**: Automatic connection management
4. **Execution**: Natural language input → tool usage → structured response
5. **Cleanup**: Automatic resource management

### Advanced Flow
1. **Multi-Agent Setup**: Orchestrator with specialized agents
2. **Handoff Logic**: Agents determine when to hand off tasks
3. **Context Preservation**: Seamless context transfer between agents
4. **Result Aggregation**: Combine results from multiple agents

### Research Flow
1. **Query Analysis**: Understanding research intent
2. **Source Discovery**: Web search + document access
3. **Content Extraction**: Deep content analysis
4. **Synthesis**: Comprehensive research report with citations
5. **Interactive Follow-up**: Drill-down questions and clarifications

This framework transforms complex AI agent development into simple, intuitive patterns while maintaining the flexibility needed for sophisticated applications.
