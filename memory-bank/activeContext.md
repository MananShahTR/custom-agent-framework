# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current State (June 10, 2025)
The Custom AI Agents Framework is a **mature, fully-functional system** that provides a comprehensive platform for building AI agents powered by Claude.

## Recent Analysis & Documentation
Just completed a comprehensive analysis of the entire codebase to create this memory bank. Key discoveries:

### Architecture Insights
- **Clean, production-ready codebase** with excellent separation of concerns
- **Async-first design** throughout for optimal performance
- **Resource management** is properly handled (MCP connections, API clients)
- **Error handling** is comprehensive with fallbacks and logging

### Current Capabilities
The framework is **feature-complete** for its intended use cases:

1. **Agent Types Available**:
   - `BaseAgent`: Abstract foundation for all agents
   - `Agent`: General-purpose agent with tool composition
   - `WebSearchAgent`: Optimized for web research tasks
   - `DeepResearchAgent`: Advanced research with citations and structured reports
   - `MultiAgentSystem`: Orchestrated multi-agent workflows

2. **Tool Ecosystem**:
   - **Web Tools**: BraveSearchTool, FirecrawlContentTool
   - **Google Tools**: GoogleDriveTool, GoogleDriveContentTool  
   - **System Tools**: RequestApprovalTool, HandoffTool
   - **MCP Tools**: Dynamic tool loading from MCP servers

3. **Integration Capabilities**:
   - **MCP Protocol**: Full support for external tool servers
   - **Web Search**: Brave Search API with Firecrawl content extraction
   - **Google Drive**: OAuth2 authentication with content extraction
   - **Multi-Agent**: Agent handoff and coordination patterns

## Key Patterns & Preferences

### Code Architecture Patterns
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Tools as composable components
- **Dependency Injection**: Client injection for testability
- **Factory Pattern**: MCP connection creation
- **Context Management**: AsyncExitStack for resource cleanup
- **Registry Pattern**: Dictionary-based tool lookup

### API Design Philosophy
- **Simplicity First**: 3-line agent creation for basic use cases
- **Progressive Complexity**: Advanced features available when needed
- **Async by Default**: All I/O operations are async with sync wrappers
- **Configuration Objects**: Dataclasses for type-safe configuration

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallbacks for external service failures
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Debug information when verbose=True
- **Resource Cleanup**: Guaranteed cleanup via context managers
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages without exposing internals

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### 1. **MCP Integration Philosophy**
- **Lazy Loading**: MCP connections established on first use, not construction
- **Permanent Tools**: MCP tools added to agent permanently (not temporarily)
- **Error Tolerance**: MCP setup failures don't break agent creation
- **Resource Management**: Explicit cleanup() method required

### 2. **Tool Execution Strategy**
- **Parallel by Default**: Tools execute concurrently for performance
- **Sequential Option**: Available when order matters
- **Error Isolation**: One tool failure doesn't break others
- **Result Aggregation**: All results returned regardless of individual failures

### 3. **Agent Specialization Approach**
- **BaseAgent Foundation**: Abstract base with core functionality
- **Specialized Implementations**: Each agent type optimizes for specific use cases
- **System Prompt Customization**: Each agent has tailored system prompts
- **Tool Auto-loading**: Convenience flags for common tool combinations

## Learnings & Project Insights

### What Works Exceptionally Well
1. **Developer Experience**: The API is intuitive and well-documented
2. **Production Readiness**: Comprehensive error handling and resource management
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add custom tools and agent types
4. **MCP Integration**: Seamless integration with external tool servers
5. **Examples Coverage**: Comprehensive examples for all major use cases

### Architecture Strengths
1. **Clean Separation**: Agents, tools, and utilities are well-separated
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints throughout
3. **Async Performance**: Parallel tool execution and non-blocking I/O
4. **Configuration Management**: Centralized, type-safe configuration
5. **Testing Support**: Async test patterns and mock-friendly design

### Framework Maturity Indicators
- **Complete Tool Ecosystem**: Web search, Google Drive, MCP, approval systems
- **Multiple Agent Types**: From basic to specialized research agents
- **Production Features**: Logging, error handling, resource cleanup
- **Developer Tools**: Comprehensive examples, setup scripts, documentation
- **Integration Patterns**: Clear patterns for custom tools and agents

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### For Framework Maintenance
1. **Documentation**: The framework would benefit from API documentation generation
2. **Testing**: Additional integration tests for edge cases
3. **Performance**: Monitoring and optimization for large-scale usage
4. **Community**: Guide for contributing custom tools and agents

### For New Development
The framework is **ready for production use** and new development should focus on:
1. **Domain-Specific Agents**: Building specialized agents for specific industries
2. **Custom Tools**: Extending the tool ecosystem for specific APIs/services
3. **Multi-Agent Patterns**: Advanced coordination and workflow patterns
4. **Integration Examples**: More real-world integration scenarios

This is a **mature, well-architected framework** that successfully achieves its goals of simplifying AI agent development while maintaining production-ready standards.
